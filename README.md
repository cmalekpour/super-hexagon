super-hexagon solution
---

You will need the cross compilers for aarch64 and arm. Check compile.sh for the binaries we need specifically. You also need to move all files in this directory to `/home/super_hexagon` on your system.

After setup, you can run `python2 test.py` to load and pwn the binary :)
